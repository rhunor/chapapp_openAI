Welcome to the Vite Chat Application! This is a project that combines the power of Chat Engine and the OpenAI API to create an interactive chat room with an AI assistant chat bot, AI code bot, and autocomplete features.

## Features

- **Chat Room:** The application uses Chat Engine to provide a real-time chat room where users can interact with each other.

- **AI Assistant Chat Bot:** The OpenAI API powers an AI assistant chat bot, which can answer questions, engage in casual conversations, and provide helpful information to users.

- **AI Code Bot:** The AI code bot assists users with programming-related queries and can provide code snippets or explanations for various programming languages and concepts.

- **Autocomplete:** The chat input is equipped with an autocomplete feature, which suggests relevant completions to users as they type their messages. This helps in enhancing the overall chatting experience and reduces errors.

## How to Use

5. **Autocomplete Messages:** While typing your messages in the chat room, you'll notice autocomplete suggestions to enhance your chatting experience.
